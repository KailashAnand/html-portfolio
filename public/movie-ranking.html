<h1> The Best Movies According to Kailash!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Iron Man 1</h3>
<p>
    Great characters, great development. The gpaphics are also very nice. Overall a 12/10. Must watch for sci-fi fans.
</p>
<h3>Star Wars: Episode 3</h3>
<p>
    Brilliant potrayal of Anakins emotions and the way palpatine moulded him into Darth Vader was an emotional roller coaster. 
    Darth Vader's suit is an eye-candy as a bonus
</p>
<h3>Sully</h3>
<p>
    What can I say, Tom Hanks is the world's best actor.
