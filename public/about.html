            My name is Kailash Anand <br>
            I am an aspiring web developer looking to learn 
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li> 
                <li>JavaScript</li>
            </ul>

            I am currently studying in 12th grade, computer science group. In our school they primarily focus on:
            <ol>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>MySQL</li>
            </ol>
            which are very useful skills. Unfortunately they never come near the idea of web development(that's technically a lie, 
            we were taught html basics 4years ago, but there was no real practise). Therefore, I have taken it into my own hands and 
            am learning webdev myself! Hoping for a fun journey with lots of css debugging xd
